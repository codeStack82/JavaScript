                      <p class="lead">Javascript is a fairly new coding and/or scripting language
                        to me and it has proved to be some what challenging to me.
                        This is primarily because I havn't used HTML or CSS in quite
                        a while. So I had to re-learn how to write efficient code in
                        three different languages and make them all work together.
                        <br><br>
                        I believe a big part of proper error handling is understanding
                        the language(s) that you are working with. So, since I hadn't
                        used HTML or CSS in a quite a while I spent the first couple
                        weeks of this Client-side Programming class re-learning HTML
                        and CSS from the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"
                                          target="_blank"
                                          role="button">W3C</a></h2> website.
                        Once I thought had a good grasp on the HTML and CSS
                        side of this Client-side Programming class I began focusing
                        on the JavaScript coding/structure side of my projects.
                        <br><br>
                        To simplify or streamline error trapping and debigging issues
                        I try to write clean and "human readable" code because this helps
                        my eyes focus on the elements/sections in my code that might
                        need attention. This also helps me to efficiently track down any
                        bugs that might have come up while I am working on my assignments.
                        <br><br>
                        One the other things that I had to get used to was the browser
                        consoles degging tools. Overall the browser console is
                        fairly similar to other debugging tools but it does have a
                        slight learning curve. I also use console.log and alert
                        boxes to systematically deduce where a potential bug might
                        hide in my code. I find this techniqu very useful and efficient.
